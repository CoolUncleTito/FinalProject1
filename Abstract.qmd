Abstract:  

This project delves into the microbial composition of soil samples from the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) in the Desert Southwest, with a specific focus on Archaea. The SRER serves as a critical research site for understanding the ecology and management of arid landscapes. By examining the microbial communities present in the soil, we aim to gain insights into the diversity, distribution, and ecological significance of Archaea in this unique ecosystem.Â
