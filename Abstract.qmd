### This project delves into the microbial composition of soil samples from the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) in the Desert Southwest, with a specific focus on Archaea. The SRER serves as a critical research site for understanding the ecology and management of arid landscapes. By examining the microbial communities present in the soil, we aim to gain insights into the diversity, distribution, and ecological significance of Archaea in this unique ecosystem.

# Motivating Reasons:

### The need to develop a solid body of scientific information to support the restoration, preservation, and management of rangelands in the dry Southwest was the focus of research on SRER and other experimental ranges. The measurements may be used to estimate soil organic matter stocks, comprehend ecosystem nutrient status, clarify rates of microbially-mediated activities, and investigate the relationship between soil biogeochemical dynamics and variations in microbial biomass and community composition across time and geography. Moreover, soil pH and gravimetric water content—two environmental constraints on microorganisms and biogeochemical processes—are characterized by NEON.
